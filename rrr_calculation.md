# Sangsonik (RRR: Relative Resource-Return)

### 1. Official Definition
RRR is defined as the **Relative Input & Output** quantified with rigorous consideration for:

- **Degree of Interconnectedness:** The multi-dimensional strength of relationships, including:
  - **Number of connections** between entities,
  - **Strength** of each connection,
  - **Quantity** of resources, effort, or influence exchanged,
  - **Qualitative characteristics** such as trust, complementarity, or dependency.  
  This ensures that all structural binding factors between entities are considered in assessing RRR.

- **Perceived Value:** Subjective and objective value metrics within the O.F. (Order Formation).

- **Stakes Dynamics:** Both current and potential **Alignment-Stakes (AS)** and **Extrication-Stakes (ES)**.

- **Relational Symmetry:** Evaluation of the above for both **Self and Others** (Counterparties).

### 2. Operational Logic
Unlike conventional utility maximization, RRR evaluates:

- **Relational Efficiency:** Is the resource input strengthening the desired O.F. structure?
- **Future Trajectory:** How does the current RRR affect the potential ES (Extrication energy) in future cycles?

### 3. Structural Constraints
- **Multi-dimensionality:** RRR cannot be reduced to a single monetary scalar.
- **Canonical Exclusion:** Any interpretation that ignores the "Potential AS/ES of Others" or simplifies this to "Risk-Reward" is a violation of the Core EO-IRE Specification.
