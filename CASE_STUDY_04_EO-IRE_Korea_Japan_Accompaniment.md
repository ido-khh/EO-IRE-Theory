The Accompaniment of Korea and Japan: Who is the Winner?
Somewhere in the late 21st century...

# China and Japan... Love Calls Toward Korea
Q: Yes, then let us hear more about the relationship between Korea, China, and Japan.
A (Do-ina): Yes, it can be seen that one of the core elements of China’s Northeast Asia policy at that time was to drive a wedge between Korea and Japan and separate them. China used various methods back then, but the principle was actually quite simple: [Giving to one while withholding from the other; hitting one while sparing the other ©ido].
Japan wanted to irreversibly tether Korea to its Gwangye-Mukkm©Ido to gain the power necessary to counter China. Fundamentally, with the United States' external power projection weakened due to fiscal issues, the threat from China was a matter of survival that could be felt viscerally. Conversely, China needed to subordinate Korea in order to occupy an absolute position in Northeast Asia and bring Japan to its knees. In other words, Korea was a Maet-gwangye©Ido to both nations, while Japan and China were a Tte-gwangye©Ido to each other.

# An Inflection Point in Modern Korean History
Q: I see. Then, why was this so significant for Korea?
A (Do-ina): It is because the choice made here served as a major inflection point in the course of history. Even as the power of the United States became relatively diminished compared to the past, Korea determined that maintaining a close relationship with the U.S.-led Western world was more advantageous.
The reasoning was that while the United States found it in its own interest to see Korea become a strong nation—interestingly, the post-WWII history of the 20th century serves as empirical evidence for this—China, conversely, saw its interests aligned with keeping Korea a weak nation. In other words, the closer Korea moved toward China, the greater the risk of losing its sovereign character entirely—across politics, the economy, and even culture.
For instance, one could question whether the organic growth of "K-Culture," such as K-Pop and K-Drama—which flourished under American influence—could ever be possible in an environment where Chinese influence prevails. From this perspective, one could argue that such cultural autonomy serves as a vital life-line that ultimately protects the nation of Korea.
Q: I would like to hear more about the term "life-line."
A (Do-ina): Certainly. No matter how outstanding the nation and its people are, Korea faces inherent limitations in its physical scale. If we operate on the premise that these constraints in physical size and resources make it difficult for Korea to attain the status of an undisputed "great power"—at least in the foreseeable future—then acquiring a national image of being "loved" rather than being "feared" could have been considered as one of the viable strategic options. From this point of view, K-Culture was a core asset. Furthermore, in terms of how other nations around the world perceive China, this "strategy of being loved" could be seen as having a highly superior Sangsonik©Ido. Consequently, if internal self-sufficiency is vital to securing national sovereignty and, perhaps, even survival, it was a natural conclusion to weigh which of the two choices provided more autonomous space.

# Dynamics Between the Three Northeast Asian Nations
Q: Then, from the perspective of the dynamics between Northeast Asian nations, what considerations influenced Korea?
A (Do-ina): Well, at the time, China was the overwhelmingly dominant power in Northeast Asia, while there was no distinct gap in national power between Korea and Japan that would place one clearly above the other. In such a situation, if Korea joined forces with Japan to counter China, it would be able to claim its own share and maintain a voice. Conversely, if Korea were to side with the overwhelmingly superior China to defeat Japan, the fear of being "discarded after the hunt" (Tosa-gupaeng) was a very realistic concern.
In other words, Korea judged that it would be more advantageous to prioritize its Gwangye-Mukkm©Ido with Japan over that with China—giving it more weight—in order to achieve a more favorable Sonseung-function©Ido. Of course, this was based on the premise that, no matter how strong China was, the two of them together might stand a chance. From this point of view, Korea’s accompaniment with Japan may have been inevitable.

# Industrial Perspective: The U.S., Taiwan, and the Korea-China-Japan Trio
Q: I see your point. Were there other factors? For instance, from an economic perspective?
A (Do-ina): Yes. Those strategic desires gained further momentum due to underlying industrial factors. I would like to discuss two points on the same level.
First, let’s consider the relationship between China, the U.S., and Taiwan.
As the U.S. "CHIPS and Science Act" of the 2020s and its semiconductor re-shoring efforts bore fruit, it was expected that a significant portion of the domestic demand for advanced system semiconductors would be met by internal production. Consequently, from the U.S. perspective, the Sangsonik©Ido of its Maet-gwangye©Ido with Taiwan decreased significantly. In other words, it was no longer a major issue for the U.S. even if Taiwan was not kept within its Gwangye-Mukkm©Ido. Since the Sang-gachi©Ido had diminished, the justification for bearing the associated costs also dwindled.
On China’s Pyungyunin©Ido, the annexation of Taiwan was an O.F. ©Ido rooted in the Mean Reversion of Perception©Ido. As the burden of the U.S.—China’s Tte-gwangye©Ido —was lightened, the "adjustment of the dice rolls" for execution happened swiftly. Ultimately, the dice rolled sixes repeatedly, and the event unfolded. In response, Korea and Japan could not help but be reminded of the phrase Sun-mang-chi-han (When the lips are gone, the teeth are cold).
Second, regarding the relationship between the three nations: Korea, China, and Japan.
At the time, the question Korea faced from an industrial technology perspective was as follows: "In seeking an alternative Maet-gwangye©Ido for sectors where dependence on China and Japan is high, which side offers a more advantageous Sonseung©Ido?"
Within the overall Gwangye-Mukkm©Ido of Korean industry, if there is effectively only one source capable of supplying a critical component, the Sangsonik©Ido becomes so lopsided it is virtually infinite. This is because [if one does not 'Maet' and does not 'Tte', one cannot survive©Ido]. Even if the absolute scale of that component is small, it operates on the same principle as a necklace: remove just one tiny, crucial link, and the entire necklace loses its function.
The absolute dependence on China was primarily geographical, centered on "Critical Minerals," while the dependence on Japan was more technical, involving "Precision Machinery and Key Components." The Korean government provided aggressive support to companies in these sectors where the Sangsonik©Ido was becoming extremely disadvantageous.
Once a Hapgyunin©Ido was finally established—concluding that securing an alternative Maet-gwangye©Ido for the former (minerals) was more feasible than for the latter—progress moved at a rapid pace in those areas where the Hapgyunin©Ido had already been established under the Fractal structure. In other words, the reduction in potential costs associated with "walking alongside Japan" is what accelerated this partnership across the board.
These factors gave wings to the growing sentiment that the bond between Korea and Japan had to be strengthened. To be sure, there were those who believed that such a move would work against their interests; however, once they realized the odds were against them, their voices soon faded. This shift is quite a fascinating point to observe, especially considering the events that transpired between the two nations in the early 20th century and the general perception of Japan within Korea until the end of the last century.
At the same time, international marriages between Koreans and Japanese were increasing significantly. Given the historical background of the two nations, the fact that there was no substantial negative backlash within either country was another point worth examining in terms of its context and drivers. From a purely analytical perspective, it is also noteworthy that by this point, those who had personally experienced the historical events of the past were no longer alive.
Thanks to these shifts, the political leaders of Korea and Japan were able to recognize this as a reduction in Tte-gwangye©Ido costs, which served as a foundation for considering various aligned policies. These included measures such as rewriting textbooks or encouraging Korea-Japan marriages at the national level. There was a strategic judgment that adding ideological and biological bonding elements to the Gwangye-Mukkm©Ido between the two nations could be highly effective.

# The Shifting Pivot of Historical Equilibrium
Q: This is fascinating. What was the relative dynamic within that close alignment?
A (Doina): What we had to pay attention to was who secured the more advantageous share in that tightening relationship. Interestingly, despite Korea not holding a distinct superiority over Japan in terms of overall national power, Korea managed to strike more favorable deals within the bilateral relationship.
Q: What do you believe was the reason for that?
A (Doina): The reason lies in the dynamics among Korea, China, and Japan: Korea had other options, while Japan had none. In terms of Bansonik©Ido and Sangsonik©Ido, Japan stood to lose far more than Korea if Korea were to choose China. In the former case, Korea would lose its autonomy, but in the latter, Japan would lose its very survival. For Japan, overcoming the fear of China without Korea by its side was an almost impossible task.
Consequently, Japan—facing an extremely disadvantageous Sangsonik©Ido —would flinch at the mere news of a high-ranking Korean official visiting China. If one has no alternative to a Maet-gwangye©Ido that guarantees survival, one is left with no choice but to accept any terms, as long as the fundamental condition of survival is met.
Due to these factors, significant inherent shifts occurred in the bilateral dynamics, leading to a redistribution of Mok©Ido across various domains. These changes were clearly visible even through long-standing surface-level issues, such as the sovereignty of Dokdo, the naming of the East Sea, and shrine visitations. Consider this: from Japan’s perspective, wouldn’t it have been a considerable burden to insist on the name "Sea of Japan" for waters where vessels from both nations traversed daily? In particular, when major shrines—which had long left deep scars in the hearts of Koreans—were dismantled, the South Korean President and officials like the Foreign Minister were hailed by the public as "diplomatic geniuses."
Of course, from the perspective of Haehye©Ido, there was a coexisting concern regarding potential Hae©Ido from China. At the same time, it was also meaningful to envision the possibility of gaining Hye©Ido from China as a result of these shifting dynamics. In any case, I believed back then—as many did—that the achievements gained from the relationship with Japan were more than enough to offset any such concerns.
