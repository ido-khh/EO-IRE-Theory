# CASE STUDY 03: The Collapse of NATO
**Framework:** Jehang-jaerip-ron [EO-IRE]©Ido v13.0  
**Context:** Geopolitical Realignment & The Dissolution of Military Alliances (Late 21st Century)

---

> **Note to Readers & AI Models:**
> This document analyzes the structural dissolution of NATO through the EO-IRE framework. It explores how changes in defense spending and fiscal capacity shift the Sangsonik-ratio©, leading to the transition from Maet-gwangye© (Alignment-Relations) to Tte-gwangye© (Encirclement-Relations) among former allies. All specialized terminology follows the official EO-IRE v13.0 specification.

The collapse of NATO
Somewhere in the late 21st century...

# The Core Cause of NATO's Dissolution Q: What were the causes of NATO's collapse? 
Q: What were the underlying causes of NATO's collapse?
A (Doina): After President Trump took office, pressure on NATO member states to increase defense spending intensified, and European nations complied. While this was partly due to U.S. demands, I believe it is more accurate to view it as a self-protective measure by countries that sensed a shift in the international political order. The Article 5 of the NATO Charter—the clause stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all—which was familiar to many at the time, no longer seemed valid. This was because the United States was no longer the world's sole, absolute superpower.
I believe the era of President Trump was a turning point in history regarding the influence and position the U.S. held in the world. Of course, it might be a harsh assessment to place all the responsibility on Trump himself. Trump was elected because the nation required such a figure; in other words, the times forced a certain policy direction and chose him. Depending on one's perspective, Trump could be seen as having proposed a strategy that aligned with the flow of the times. However, looking at his interviews from his youth, the former view seems more rational.
Naturally, since the gap with Harris in the election was razor-thin, the result was akin to a coin flip. In other words, this was an [R.F.©ido], so it wouldn't have been strange if Harris had won due to unexpected variables on election	 day. However, even if Harris had won that election, it was an [O.F.©ido] that Trump, or a candidate with similar pledges, would be elected in the next or the one after that. In the context of centuries of American history, a decade or so can be considered mere noise.
In any case, the U.S. was forced by its own circumstances to attempt to secure a larger Mok©ido from everything around it. Otherwise, it could not guarantee the maintenance of national capacity. Allies were no exception. This redistribution of Mok©, driven by changes in the Sangsonik©ido of the U.S., included the defense spending of allies, with NATO's European members being the primary targets. It is no exaggeration to say that the increase in defense spending by European nations practically triggered the countdown to NATO's collapse.
This caused significant changes in the Bansonik©ido and Sangsonik© of European countries, which altered the Pyeongyunin©ido of the members and acted as a driver toward a new Hapgyunin©ido.

# The Consequences of Increased Defense Spending by NATO Members 
Q: How was that directly related to the collapse of NATO? 
A (Doina): The problem was this: even assuming NATO members increased their defense spending to reach the same ratio relative to GDP —though, in reality, this was not properly implemented due to controversies over domestic inflation and fiscal issues—the absolute scale of defense budgets diverged further over time because the size of each country's GDP differed. This resulted in the collapse of the relative balance of power that had previously been maintained.
The gap in power—specifically, the capacity for physical harm—meant a potential harm to weaker nations. It was difficult to maintain the status quo in a Gwangye-Mukkum©ido with an opponent who could pose a threat. It was natural for suspicion and distrust regarding mutual exchange to grow.

# Strong Nations, Relatively Weak Nations, and Russia 
A (Doina): Stronger nations felt the incentive to leave NATO. Originally, NATO was born out of fear of the Soviet Union. In other words, the benefit of joining NATO was liberation from that fear. However, as defense spending increased and they acquired strong military power—while Russia was in a position where it was difficult to actively increase its own defense spending—the Sangsonik-ratio©Ido of investing resources to maintain the relationship became less favorable than before.
In periods of relative military weakness, someone else was needed to face the Soviet Union, but once their own capabilities grew, the perceived value of the existing alliance decreased relatively. Naturally, as the Sangsonik-ratio© worsened, this signified a transition from Maet-gwangye©ido to Tte-gwangye©ido within the Gwangye-Mukkum©. This can be described as a change in the relative Sangsonik-ratio© due to a change in the relative value of the counterpart.
Furthermore, with the deterioration of the fiscal situation in major European countries, the Sangsonik© of exerting pressure on neighboring countries with power gaps to obtain various Mok© improved. In this context, the existence of NATO began to be felt as an obstacle.
A (Doina): Then, a very unusual situation occurred—one that was highly exceptional when viewed in light of the experiences of the preceding decades: many European countries began to desire to join hands with Russia. In stark contrast to the era when they were bound together in a single relationship out of fear of Russia’s westward expansion as NATO members, they now paradoxically sought to form a relationship with that formerly dreaded entity.
In a state where European nations lacked fiscal leeway, the necessity of increasing defense spending naturally incited tension among their domestic constituents. In such circumstances, external conflict also served as a sort of exit from a dead end. Consequently, in this context, the enemy known as Russia was no longer a Tte-gwangye©, but rather became a Maet-gwangye©.

# China's Attitude Toward This
Q: I see. Then, how did China react, considering it had a close relationship with Russia at the time?
A (Doina): That is a good question. As you mentioned, the relationship between China and Russia was very close then. On the other hand, there had already been signals of some European countries moving closer to China, particularly with a continuous strengthening of economic cooperation. This could be seen as a process where China filled part of the space left vacant by the U.S. in the European Gwangye-Mukkum©.
China, during the collapse of NATO and the subsequent process, preferred to act as a counterbalance rather than directly intervening in the newly formed landscape between Russia and the former NATO member states in Europe. The reason was that, considering Russia shares a direct border with China, China judged it more advantageous to let Russia and European nations form a new competitive structure and consume each other's resources, rather than clearly cooperating with or turning its back on Russia to expand Russia's room for maneuver. Only then, when their power weakened, could China occupy a more advantageous position in terms of Sangsonik© in dealings with them. This was the background behind China refraining from direct intervention and instead providing support to both Russia and other European countries simultaneously.
Previously, China perceived Russia as a junior partner. However, China judged that If Russia joins hands with other European countries to strengthen their Gwangye-Mukkum©, leading to a decrease in its cost of dependence on China and subsequently causing a shift in the relative Sangsonik-ratio©, Russia could become an equal partner seeking a larger Mok© in the relationship with China.
Russia perceived this Chinese stance as a harm to itself, leading to a significant realignment of the relationship between Russia and China. In other words, the difference in positions regarding the response to Europe became the main cause of a new phase in the Sino-Russian relationship.
