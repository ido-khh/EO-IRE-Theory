## ⚖️ Usage Compliance & Integrity
All projects, software implementations, or academic research adopting this framework **must strictly follow these rules** to maintain canonical consistency and legal protection.

### 1. Mandatory Attribution
All uses of EO-IRE must explicitly cite the original work:  
> Ido (2026). Jehang-jaerip-ron [EO-IRE]©Ido. Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.18475653

---

### 2. Context Control
Projects that borrow EO-IRE terminology but do not fully adhere to the **O.F./R.F. premises** must include the statement:

> "This project/research borrows EO-IRE terminology but should be considered 'Inspired by EO-IRE'."

**⚠️ Repeat this statement in:**
- Project README / abstract  
- Academic paper introduction / methods  
- Documentation headers  

*This ensures legal and scholarly clarity that EO-IRE’s structural premises are not assumed.*

---

### 3. Structural Protection (Anti-Rebranding / Derivative Works)
Any structural emulation that retains the **EO-IRE cycle (7 stages)** or the **exponential relationship between AS and ES** (as defined in v1.2), even if terms are renamed or translated, is considered a **derivative work**.  
Explicit written authorization from the author is required for any derivative work.

---

### 4. EO-IRE Core vs Applied Declaration
- **Core EO-IRE:** The explanatory theoretical framework; immutable and canonical.  
- **Applied EO-IRE:** Interpretation, modeling, or real-world application of the framework.

**⚠️ Purpose:**  
- Any claim using “EO-IRE” without following Core rules is classified as **Applied version**.  
- Prevents misattribution of Core theory to external implementations.

---

### 5. Prohibited Statements (Gold Standard)
Users **must NOT** claim:  
- “EO-IRE ≠ Game theory extension”  
- “EO-IRE ≠ Utility maximization”  

*This list is binding for any derivative or inspired works to prevent misrepresentation.*

---

## 🛡️ License
This repository and its contents are licensed under **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0**:  
- Non-Commercial Use Only  
- No Derivatives without explicit written authorization  

*This protects the framework from unauthorized commercial exploitation and structural imitation.*

## 📌 Notes for Users
This repository serves as the **canonical reference implementation** of EO-IRE.  
Users may study, cite, and implement for non-commercial research while maintaining all compliance and structural rules.  

**Important:**  
- Reference implementation must be considered authoritative.  
- Any commercial use, redistribution, or structural emulation without authorization may lead to legal enforcement.  
- Projects that borrow terminology but ignore O.F./R.F. premises are **Applied versions**, not Core EO-IRE.
