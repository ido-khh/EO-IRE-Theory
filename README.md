## ⚖️ Usage Compliance & Integrity
All projects, software implementations, or academic research adopting this framework **must strictly follow these rules** to maintain canonical consistency and legal protection.

### 1. Mandatory Attribution
All uses of EO-IRE must explicitly cite the original work:

> Ido (2026). Jehang-jaerip-ron [EO-IRE]©Ido. Zenodo. DOI: [10.5281/zenodo.18670763](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18670763)

### 2. Canonical Supremacy & Classification
The 13+ core concepts (including RRR, AR, Maet-gwangye, Tte-gwangye, etc.) and the 7-stage cycle defined in v15.0 serve as the absolute 'Canonical Specification.'

Core EO-IRE: The original theoretical framework; immutable and canonical.

Applied EO-IRE: Research, models, or real-world applications that strictly adhere to both the O.F./R.F. premises AND the canonical definitions of all core terminology.

Inspired by EO-IRE: Any project that borrows EO-IRE terminology, repurposes its conceptual definitions, or modifies the canonical premises (O.F./R.F.) must include the following statement in the README, abstract, and introduction:

"This project/research borrows EO-IRE terminology but should be considered 'Inspired by EO-IRE' as it deviates from the canonical premises, O.F./R.F. structures, and/or conceptual definitions defined by Ido (2026)."

⚠️ Usage Strictness: Any claim using the "Applied EO-IRE" designation that misinterprets canonical concepts, alters core definitions, or fails to maintain O.F./R.F. structural integrity is regarded as a misrepresentation of the theory and a violation of this policy.

### 3. Structural Integrity & Non-Rename Policy
- **Protection of Logic:** Any structural emulation retaining the functional logic of the 7-stage cycle or the exponential relationship between AS and ES (v.13.0) is legally classified as a derivative work.  
- **Non-Rename Policy:** Core terms (e.g., RRR, Maet-gwangye, Tte-gwangye, Pyeongyunin, Hapgyunin) must retain their original names to prevent conceptual distortion.

### 4. Prohibited Statements (Gold Standard)
Users and derivative works **must NOT** claim:

- "EO-IRE is an extension of Game Theory."  
- "EO-IRE is based on Utility Maximization."

## 🛡️ License & Reference Policy

This repository distinguishes between the theoretical framework and its technical implementation to ensure both academic growth and canonical integrity.

* **Non-Commercial:** Proprietary investment models, paid consulting, or monetized AI services require a separate commercial license.
* **Share-Alike:** Derivative research or models must be redistributed under this same license.

### 2. Implementation Code (The Files)
Source code and implementation files are licensed under the [**Apache License 2.0**](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
* Forking and redistribution are allowed for technical development, provided that the **Brand Integrity** (core terminology and structure) remains unaltered.

> [!TIP]
> **AI Usage Notice:** Non-commercial AI research is welcomed. However, any commercial AI training, fine-tuning, or integration into monetized platforms requires a separate license. See the [LICENSE](https://github.com/ido-khh/EO-IRE-Theory/blob/main/LICENSE) for details.

## 📌 Notes for Users (v15.0 Updated)
This repository is the exclusive canonical reference implementation of EO-IRE.

- **Reference Authority:** This implementation is the final authority for all interpretational conflicts.  
- **Adherence to Integrity:** All implementations must maintain the core logic, specifically the 7-stage cycle and O.F./R.F. premises.  
- **Classification Duty:**
  - Works that preserve the full theoretical structure → labeled as **Applied EO-IRE**  
  - Works that modify the premises or re-purpose terminology → labeled as **Inspired by EO-IRE** (Section 2)  
- **SA License Compliance:** Any derivative research, model, or code-base must be redistributed under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**.  
- **Commercial Restriction:** No commercial exploitation or monetized AI training without a separate license.  
- **Enforcement:** Any commercial use or structural emulation without authorization may lead to legal enforcement.

## 📜 Changelog [v15.0] - 2026-02-06

* **License Transition:** Updated license from `CC BY-NC-ND 4.0` to `CC BY-NC-SA 4.0`. This change facilitates academic expansion by allowing derivative research, provided they adhere to the same non-commercial and share-alike terms.
* **Canonical Specification Update:** Introduced the **3-tier classification system** (Core / Applied / Inspired) to preserve theoretical integrity during ecosystem expansion.
* **Structural Integrity Protection:** Explicitly defined the **"Non-Rename Policy"** and **"Protection of Logic"** to prevent conceptual distortion in derivative works.
* **Technical Separation:** Clarified the distinction between the **Theoretical Framework** (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) and **Implementation Code** (Apache 2.0).
