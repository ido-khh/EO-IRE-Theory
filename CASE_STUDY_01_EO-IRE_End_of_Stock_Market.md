The End of the Stock Market
Somewhere in the late 21st century…

Q: Good day, viewers. Today, we are joined by the legendary investor, Doina. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doina. You are widely known for achieving exceptional performance in the stock market. Many are eager to hear the thoughts and experiences you gained during that journey—though it is true that public perception of the stock market has shifted significantly compared to the past.
A (Doina): Hello. It is a pleasure to be here. Thank you for the kind words. To begin with, you are correct; there are certainly thoughts and experiences I gained through that process. However, in truth, my philosophy was not so much "earned" during that journey as it was that the journey itself was a process of "realizing" a pre-established philosophy.
Indeed, the concept of stock investment no longer exists today. There is no longer any meaning in a corporation raising capital from the private sector, specifically from individuals. Nevertheless, I believe it is still meaningful to discuss this foundation. This is because human activity—and by extension, corporate and state activity—is entirely based on the Sonseung-function[RWF]©Ido, which is rooted in Sangsonik©Ido.
From this perspective, the essence of all living activity can be defined as an act of investment. It is merely that the Sangsonik-ratio©Ido, the win rate, the actor, and the object differ. In some cases, the Sonseung—a composite metric of the Profit/Loss (P/L) ratio and Win rate—is so distinct that it becomes difficult to perceive it as such. The simplest examples are walking and running. The win rate converges toward 100%. Yet, it is likely not 100%—especially if you recall the memories of falling down as a child. Eating is the same. Shall we look at it the other way? The probability of missing your mouth with a spoon is also very low. Then there are things with much lower probabilities: shooting a three-pointer in basketball or hitting a pitcher’s ball for a base hit in baseball.
Ah, I used the word "investment." If we view investment as the act of committing resources, this term can embrace all those activities. Furthermore, when bringing this into the asset market, I would say it is a convincing argument that focusing on the "object" within the framework of "Object-Supply/Demand-Price" is investment, while focusing on "Supply/Demand" is speculation. Nevertheless, if the term "investment" is intended as I mentioned earlier, no linguistic misunderstanding should occur.
Therefore, I believe these contents provide useful food for thought for life, corporate business, and national strategy, even if they are no longer about the stock investments of the past.

# The Inflection Point
Q: I am curious why you spoke of a major transition in the US stock market at that time.
A (Doina): As with all things in existence, the concepts of "Birth-Growth-Decay-End" naturally apply to the stock market. That was a very interesting period, one could say. It was a time not far from the inflection point at the top-level iteration of the stock market's fractal structure. "U.S. stocks had been rising consistently—at least to the extent that cognitive convenience was maintained—and because this trend persisted for decades, it was sufficient to be felt as an absolute truth. Back then, the belief that 'long-term investment in U.S. indices equals ultimate victory' was treated like a natural law. Even financial advisors held such unwavering faith in this pattern that they didn't hesitate to prescribe it as a universal solution for their clients."
As you well know, the opposite situation unfolded over the following decades. Contrary to previous common sense, it became the new common sense for the US stock market to decline. 
Everything is subject to fluctuations. This includes changes in the weather—such as temperature, the intensity of snow and rain, and the number of rainy days per year—as well as physical health, examination scores, the number of corporations and customers, and even one's own internal attitude toward others. The perception of value for a specific object, and the resulting perception of the Sangsonik-ratio©, triggers a new Order©Ido in asset prices. The magnitude and period of a wave are dependent variables characterized by R.F.©Ido. Of course, since these are somewhat dependent on the magnitude of previously formed waves, the character of O.F.©Ido also coexists. The important point is that the US stock market was one of the largest among all existing assets in the world. By chance (R.F.©), the time it took to reach its final inflection point was longer than a human lifetime. And, coincidentally, the United States has sustained continuous growth without collapse since World War II. For most people who lived through this era, it was sufficient to foster a belief in eternal ascent. This is akin to climbing a mountain with an extraordinarily high peak. As one ascends a mountain so tall that its summit is hidden behind thick clouds, might they eventually succumb to the belief that the mountain itself is infinite and will never end?
Please do not misunderstand: I am not claiming to have known the exact moment of that inflection point. What I knew at the time was simply the fact of its existence, not its precise timing or the magnitude of the resulting wave. This distinction arises because the existence of an inflection point is a characteristic of O.F.©, whereas the latter—the exact point and scale—falls within R.F.©. However, given it was a period where one could reasonably question if U.S. relative national power had peaked, and considering that the international order built upon it might consequently shift its form, it was worth speculating that the passage of time was converging toward that inflection. Above all, if we regard the existence of a life cycle in all things as O.F.©, then the existence of an inflection point must also be considered O.F.©..

# O.F. © and R.F. ©
Perhaps the concepts of O.F. © and R.F. © are confusing. Let’s think of it this way: the reason we can see an animal and know its species is because that is O.F. © The reason we can distinguish individuals within the same species is that R.F. © is subordinate to O.F. © Similarly, O.F. © carries the characteristics of R.F. © Thus, while the species maintains its continuity, interestingly, variations within the species also emerge. The fact that human heights vary individually yet cluster around an average value follows this same principle. Occasionally, an individual significantly deviates from the mean—standing over two meters tall—which is akin to throwing multiple dice and having all of them land on six. If one continues to throw the dice, the result will eventually converge toward 3.5. This applies not only to height but to every characteristic. Some individuals possess abnormally high or low intelligence. Plants, animals, humans, societies, corporations, and states all exist within this framework. The price movements of corporations within the stock market are no exception
Q: Are you saying that "Beginning and End" are O.F. ©, and "Regression to the Mean" is also O.F. ©?
A (Doina): Exactly. To elaborate, the existence of a framework—the ability to perceive a "frame"—is because it is O.F. © And, at least as long as the existing Order©Ido is maintained, regression to the mean acts as the driving force (dong-in) for maintaining that Order©Ido. From this perspective, it can be said that [Disorder exists within Order, and Order itself is inherently disorderly©Ido]. Distinguishing what is O.F. © and what is R.F. © is extremely important.

# The Calculator That Devoured the Stock Market
A major issue at that time was what people were used to calling "AI"—essentially "calculation software with drastically improved performance compared to the past." There was no doubt that its emergence brought about a fundamental shift in the way society operates—much like the wheel, the washing machine, the telephone, and the computer once did. While determining which of these sparked the most significant transformation is beyond the scope of this discussion, it is certain that they reshaped the world. These innovations expanded the field in which capable individuals could exercise their prowess, and consequently, a widening wealth gap followed as a natural byproduct.
The problem was the need to ask: "Have people developed excessively high expectations regarding what is actually possible versus what is potentially possible?" At that time, spearheaded by YouTube, the media was flooded with reports on the current status and future outlook of the field. Voices emerged from industry insiders, specialists, and even researchers in peripheral disciplines. Among them, some may have lacked technical depth; however, even for those with profound expertise, one could reasonably question whether they were incentivized to exaggerate realized or potential effects—each operating within their own Sonseung-function©.
After all, it was a race to the death. The manifestation of the Gumgigi©Ido dynamics—where one must eat even if it might cause sickness, because not eating means death. A state where one becomes willing to bear any cost in terms of Sangsonik©. It was undeniable that AI had catalyzed significant changes. However, when considering the weighting of its actual capabilities and potential, people might have believed its impact to be at a level of 200, 300, or even 1,000, even if the realistic expectation was closer to 100. Some individuals held beliefs regarding the ripple effects, feasibility, and timing of these latent technologies that were far more optimistic than the norm. Make no mistake: at that time, one had to be cautious about concluding they were wrong. Ultimately, it was a matter of pure stochastics.

Ah, for reference, this process I just mentioned can also be called O.F. © However, the specific details within that frame are R.F. © The frame remains the same, but the stage, the actors, and the objects change every time. The Tulip Mania, the Dot-com bubble, and the U.S. housing bubble of the 2000s, and so on.
People often tend to misidentify phenomena belonging to R.F.©Ido as O.F.©Ido when random occurrences repeat by chance. If a coin or a die yields the same result several times in a row, some begin to perceive it as a rule—mistaking R.F.© for O.F.©. However, as previously mentioned, it is crucial to discern what truly constitutes O.F.©, for this discernment plays a decisive role in determining one's ultimate performance.
The same can be said for current AI development and other technological advancements. Relying on the fact that developmental progress has appeared linear over a certain period to predict what will emerge years from now—under the assumption that such a trend will persist—is a prime example of this fallacy.

# Regression to the Mean as O.F.
Q: I see. You previously stated that regression to the mean is O.F. © What is the reason we can trust this?
A (Doina): The reason is that if the O.F. © of regression to the mean stops working, not only do asset markets like the stock market fail to function, but the very existence of natural systems becomes impossible. Without mean reversion, neither systems nor science itself could possibly be sustained. The existence of systems and rules themselves is proof of the existence of O.F. © ; for they constitute the fundamental premise and the bedrock of the world in which we are able to exist." Therefore, we can have faith that anything will return to the mean as the number of trials increases, at least as long as we are alive.
Q: What do you mean by "the world in which we can exist"?
A (Doina): Just as I said—disorder exists within Order©Ido, and Order©Ido itself is inherently disorderly—the world we exist in is the same. It is just that it is very difficult to know the magnitude and period of its waves. This then leads to an inevitable question: "How long" can humanity continue to exist? In addition, if the moment ever comes when Regression to the Mean ceases to function, will humanity still be around to witness it?
Returning to the point, from the perspective of O.F.© and R.F.©, what was more important than whether it was a "bubble" was the fact that the US stock market was not far from the inflection point at the very top of the fractal structure. Moreover, even from the standpoint of Regression to the Mean, it was clear that the situation at that time had significantly deviated from the norm.
Ultimately, the thought that it regressed to the mean last time and will return to the mean this time is correct. Because that is O.F. © However, I am cautious about stating the exact timing. Because that is R.F. ©
