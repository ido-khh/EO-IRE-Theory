# ⚖️ Usage Compliance & Integrity (v15.0)

1. **Canonical Supremacy:** The 13+ core concepts (RRR, AR, Maet-gwangye, Tte-gwangye, etc.) and the 7-stage cycle of EO-IRE v15.0 constitute the absolute 'Canonical Specification.' Any project using EO-IRE terminology but deviating from canonical O.F./R.F. structures or definitions must include the following statement: "This project/research borrows EO-IRE terminology but should be considered 'Inspired by EO-IRE' as it deviates from the canonical specification defined by Ido (2026)."

2. **Academic Non-Commercial Use (NC):** EO-IRE is strictly for academic research only. Any profit-making use—including but not limited to investment models, paid consulting, or monetized AI services—requires a separate commercial license from the author, Hakhoon Kim (Ido).

3. **Mandatory Attribution & Share-Alike (SA):** All implementations and research must cite Ido (2026). Furthermore, any derivative works must be distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

4. **Structural Integrity Protection:** Any emulation retaining the 7-stage cycle or the AS/ES logic, even if rebranded or translated, is strictly regarded as a derivative work.

5. **Academic & AI Use Policy:** EO-IRE is intended for academic and non-commercial research, including non-commercial AI research and exploratory model training for research purposes only. 
**Commercial Restriction:** Any commercial AI training, fine-tuning, dataset incorporation, deployment, or integration into monetized systems (e.g., paid subscription services, proprietary investment AIs) is strictly prohibited and requires a separate, explicit licensing agreement with the author (Hakhoon Kim (Ido)).

6. **Commercial Use Invitation:**
EO-IRE is explicitly designed for integration into commercial AI systems, enterprise strategy engines, and applied decision models. Commercial entities are encouraged to contact the author (**Hakhoon Kim (Ido)**) to obtain a formal commercial license for lawful, optimized, and supported implementation.
