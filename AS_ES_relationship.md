# AS (맺몫) ↔ ES (떼몫) Relationship (Exponential Scale)

### 1. The Core Principle
In the EO-IRE framework, the relationship between **Alignment-Stakes (AS)** and **Extrication-Stakes (ES)** is defined by **non-linear, exponential tension.**

### 2. Structural Dynamics
- **Binding Phase:** As AS (Alignment-Stakes) increases through interconnectedness, the structural entropy of the system decreases, locking the entities into a specific order.
- **Escape Phase:** ES (Extrication-Stakes) represents the energy/resource required to break this order. 
- **Exponential Growth:** The energy required for ES does not grow at the same rate as AS. Once AS crosses a critical threshold, the ES required for extrication grows **exponentially ($e^{AS}$)**.

### 3. Strategic Implication
- Entities often underestimate the future ES while increasing current AS.
- High-AS configurations create "Relational Inertia," where the cost of order-breaking becomes prohibitive, leading to systemic lock-in.

### 4. Canonical Restriction
Any model or interpretation representing the AS-ES relationship as linear, proportional, or additive is a deviation from Core EO-IRE.

- **Maet-gwangye (AR: Alignment-Relation):** The binding phase where an agent connects to a relation to achieve orientation and secure survival. This builds **AS (Alignment-Stakes)**.
- **Tte-gwangye (ER: Extrication-Relation):** The release phase where an agent must be extricated from a relation to secure further survival. This requires **ES (Extrication-Stakes)**.
- **The Exponential Tension:** As the intensity of Maet-gwangye (AR) increases, the energy required for Tte-gwangye (ER) grows exponentially ($e^{AS}$).
