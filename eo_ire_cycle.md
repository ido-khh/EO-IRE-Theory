# The Official EO-IRE 7-Stage Cycle

The EO-IRE framework operates through a continuous, 7-stage cycle of order formation and reorganization. Any implementation must respect this sequence to maintain canonical integrity.

### 1. Shift in Sangsonik (RRR) on the Established Order
The cycle begins when the existing equilibrium shifts, altering the Relative Resource-Return (RRR) within the current system.

### 2. Emergence of Dissatisfaction (Pyeongyunin: DEP)
Disequilibrium in the agents' **Pyeongyunin (DEP: Desired Equilibrium Point)** leads to systemic dissatisfaction as the current order fails to meet the required RRR.

### 3. Reaching the Tipping Point (RRR-Ratio)
The dissatisfaction intensifies until the **Sangsonik-ratio (RRR-ratio)** reaches a critical tipping point, making the current order unsustainable.

### 4. Maet-Tte (AE: Alignment-Extrication)
Active **Maet-Tte (AE)** occurs. Agents begin releasing existing ties (Tte) and forming new ones (Maet) to reorganize the **Gwangye-Mukkum (BR: Binding-Relation/Bundle)**.

### 5. Feedback Loop Activation
The activation of the feedback loop facilitates the optimization of the new RRR, testing the stability and efficiency of the newly forming relations.

### 6. Order Establishment (Hapgyunin: SEP)
A new **Hapgyunin (SEP: Settled Equilibrium Point)** is reached, and a new stable Order is established based on the optimized RRR.

### 7. Re-Entry: Shift in Sangsonik (Cycle Restart)
The new order eventually faces its own shift in Sangsonik, restarting the cycle to Stage 1. This ensures the continuous evolution of the system.

### 🛡️ Implementation Rule
Any structural emulation of EO-IRE must account for the **closed-loop nature** of these 7 stages. Misrepresenting the cycle as a linear progression is considered a violation of the Core Specification.
