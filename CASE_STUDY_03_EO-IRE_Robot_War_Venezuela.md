Super Robot Wars: The War Where No One Dies (feat. Venezuela)
Sometime in the late 21st Century

# The Reason Behind the U.S. Invasion of Venezuela
Q: What should we consider to be the reason the United States invaded Venezuela at that time?
A (Doina): Well, the reason the U.S. initiated military action back then was, quite simply, because they were losing to China. To use a football (soccer) analogy: it was the 70th or 80th minute of the match, and they were trailing 0–1.
They judged that if the game continued as it was, defeat would be inevitable. Therefore, they pushed forward to score a goal, even if it meant risking further goals against them.
In this sense, the nature of this conflict differs from the Vietnam War or the Gulf War of the previous century (the 20th century). While U.S. wars in the last century were primarily driven by the mechanics of Kiugi©Ido—a display of power while already winning—the military actions of the early part of this century were a struggle while losing. That is, they were primarily a result of the mechanics of Gumgigi©Ido.
At the time, Venezuela served as one of China's major sources of crude oil imports; it was a component within China's "Relationship Bundle." The U.S. wanted to discipline this proxy and incorporate them into their own Relationship Bundle through Haehye©Ido. To win the match, they had to aggressively occupy spaces—particularly those that could be understood as part of China’s encirclement strategy. If we judge these actions solely on the basis of victory or defeat, they can be seen as advantageous from the perspective of Sangsonik©Ido.

# Proxy Warrior (Proxy Agent)
Q: Proxy Warrior? What exactly does that mean?
A (Doina): Yes, it means exactly what it sounds like—that Venezuela acted as a proxy for China's will; in other words, China’s will was reflected through them. At the time, when people or the media heard the term "proxy war," they often thought of conflicts between small-to-medium nations in certain parts of the Middle East, particularly those where the power of representative forces like Saudi Arabia and Iran was projected. However, strictly speaking, every existing "will" can be viewed as a Proxy Warrior. This is because, in reality, [every action taken by a being with a will is the result of a compromise between its own will and the will of others©Ido].
Therefore, from the perspective of the U.S., which viewed China as a Tte-gwangye©Ido, Venezuela was regarded as part of that same Tte-gwangye©Ido. By doing so, the U.S. manifested its intention to alter China’s Son-seung Function©Ido.
Regardless, historians today interpret the U.S. military actions of the late 2020s as a turning point and a flare signaling a new phase in the US-China confrontation. This is due to the fundamental nature of the military actions I mentioned earlier.

# China’s Response
Q: I see. Then, what was China’s reaction at that time?
A (Doina): Aside from political maneuvers, including official press statements, China did not immediately attempt any physical retaliation to correct the imbalance based on their Pyeongyunin©Ido. It can be viewed that they waited until their own Sonseung-function©Ido could guarantee a more favorable Sangsonik©Ido. You could say they chose an option positioned further down the line among various time-delayed alternatives.
Instead, China focused all its efforts on robotics technology—specifically, the development of Robot Warriors capable of being deployed in combat. Then, as mentioned when discussing Korea-Japan relations, once Taiwan was brought under their complete control and the factors that could have been significant weaknesses were resolved, they judged that they had reached a point where the Sangsonik©Ido was in their favor. It was then that they began taking full-scale action.

# Resource Wars by Robots
Such conflicts primarily took place in regions commonly referred to as the "Third World"—Africa, South America, and parts of Asia. These regions became the primary focal points of physical collision because they were geographically distant from the superpowers' mainlands—meaning their citizens didn't have to experience the pain of war directly—while being rich in Ban-gachi©Ido resources like lithium, cobalt, and various rare earth elements. For the small, weak nations possessing these resources, it was an absolute catastrophe. From their perspective, "strange machines" would arrive, fight one another, and literally lay waste to their country.
An implicit agreement between the U.S. and China played a role here: a mutual understanding that neither would physically attack the other's mainland. The outcome of their struggle would be decided by contests outside their sovereign territories. Of course, as the war intensified excessively, it became common to gauge the outcome in advance based on accumulated data, without the need for actual physical combat.
For those in power, this method was preferred. it allowed them to engage in substantive competition with rivals and accumulate costs against them without causing their own citizens to feel the direct impact. As a side note, this shares a similar sentiment to the thoughts one might have while observing an ant hill as a child.
Q: I understand what you mean. But an ant hill? What do you mean by that?
A (Doina): Yes. When you were a child and went up a hill to find a cluster of ant hills, if you blocked the entrance of one hill out of mischief, the ants living there would fall into a state of total chaos. Yet, the ants in the hill right next to it would continue their peaceful existence as if nothing had happened. Human society is the same. While people in a neighboring country or a nation across the ocean are struggling for survival and losing everything they have, people in other nations go about their daily lives as if nothing is wrong. It is as if one person's despair has no effect—neither positive nor negative—on another's happiness. If someone were to watch this from outside the Earth, wouldn't they feel the same way humans do when looking at ants? Don't misunderstand me—I'm not saying this is a "problem" or that it's "wrong."

# The War Where No One Dies
Q: That’s fascinating. I also think the deployment of robots into combat instead of humans was a defining characteristic compared to previous eras.
A (Doina): Correct. And what was truly peculiar about this mode of combat, compared to wars of the past, was that there were almost no casualties when China moved into active military operations. Aside from a few outlier cases that could be attributed to the specific intent or recklessness of those in supreme control of the state, the absence of "killed in action" in the traditional sense was a striking departure from earlier forms of warfare. In conflicts between major powers, humans were not directly deployed to the front lines. Furthermore, the soldiers of the target nations—those competing for or defending their resources—could not even dare to set foot on the battlefield.
This represented a revolutionary shift compared to any war in human history. It was a war where no one died—a "Robot War" fought by machines, not people. For the state, this meant a radical improvement in the Bansonik©Ido of war, as the "public opinion cost" was drastically reduced. There is simply no comparison between the public’s reaction to the death of a son or a spouse versus the loss of a "piece of property" owned by the government or a corporation—at least on the surface.

# ‘Saso©Ido’, The Fallen Nations
Q: I see. On the other hand, it occurs to me that—as with any other field—there must have been a gap in robot technology between nations. How did this technological disparity play out?
A (Doina): Well, along with the improvement in the Bansonik©Ido and Sangsonik©Ido of physical conflicts between states, there was the factor of technological gaps. Nations that failed to cross the threshold during the transition to a robot-automated economy faced accelerating fiscal crises. Consequently, on the stage of international relations, they fell into the status of Maet-mok©Ido redefined through the Principle of Saso©Ido
One could say this played a role in the frequent outbreaks of war among major powers. In other words, the shifts in Bansonik©Ido and Sangsonik©Ido—driven by the application of robots and AI—acted as a fundamental mechanism that led to a "regression to the mean" in the frequency of wars between major global powers. Of course, it is only proper to simultaneously perceive this as a result of internal energy dynamics within the O.F.©Ido—which, generally speaking, humans can neither recognize nor perceive.
Q: It is quite striking that the O.F.©Ido you mentioned regarding the U.S. stock market is equally effective in analyzing the dynamics between nations on the international stage. You spoke of "Maet-mok©Ido redefined through the Principle of Saso©Ido"—could you elaborate on what that means?
A (Doina): Certainly. It refers to a situation where Maet-Tte©Ido—the process of clearing and restructuring stakes—becomes increasingly active between nations that have lost their competitive edge due to fiscal crises and those that have maintained or strengthened theirs. In this context, an incentive arises for the latter to Saso©Ido the former. As major powers engage in a new kind of competition over these declining states, I described the latter as Maet-mok©Ido redefined through the Principle of Saso©Ido.
Q: I see. Does this mean those nations became tangibly subordinated to the major powers?
A (Doina): Correct. Within the shifting perception of what constitutes "permissible action"—and as the international order was being rebuilt—the widening disparity in national power accelerated this process. This led to a transformation of global borders; specifically, it resulted in a significant reduction in the number of official sovereign states.

# The Great Liquidation
Q: Hearing this makes me reflect deeply on the role and value of human beings.
A (Doina): That is a natural progression of thought. The warfare of this period served a function in another respect as well. One of the critical concerns for leaders of major advanced nations at the time was that, as the universal utilization of robots in industry became commonplace, serious questions began to arise regarding the contribution and inherent value of humans in the production of goods and services.
In other words, while in the past a large percentage of humans were productive beings who produced more than they consumed, the integration of robots and AI transformed humans into entities that primarily generate costs. From the state's perspective, the majority of the citizenry transitioned from a Maet-gwangye©Ido to a Tte-gwangye©Ido.
Think about it—looking back, even into the early 21st century, one of the common concerns among advanced nations worldwide was the fear of population decline due to low birth rates. As the average age increased, the population that consumed without producing grew, while the highly productive youth population dwindled. It was only natural to perceive this as a crisis. Indeed. However, the proliferation of robots transformed not just the elderly, but the entire population across all age groups, into entities that primarily consume.
This led policymakers into a dilemma that was the exact opposite of their previous concerns. They were no longer asking, "How can we increase the population?" but rather, "How can we reduce it?" This shift was rooted in research conducted specifically on the Threshold Population—the minimum number of people required to ensure a meaningful talent pool and guarantee a nation's peak competitiveness, given its scale and characteristics. The problem was that the actual population at the time was found to be far higher than the Optimal Population derived from those studies.
Q: So, you are referring to that precise point where the population is neither too large nor too small?
A (Doina): Yes, exactly. To cultivate talent, both the individuals themselves and a robust System—meaning not just tangible infrastructure but also intangible assets like tacit knowledge—are required. Even assuming that all necessary systems are in place, there was a fundamental premise that an Optimal Population exists which that system can most efficiently accommodate.

A (Doina): Yes, exactly. To cultivate talent, both the individuals themselves and a robust System—meaning not just tangible infrastructure but also intangible assets like tacit knowledge—are required. Even assuming that all necessary systems are in place, there was a fundamental premise that an Optimal Population exists which that system can effectively support.
Q: It is difficult to grasp the idea of a concerted effort to reduce the population. How exactly was this carried out?
A (Doina): From the state's perspective, a "Great Cleanup" was necessary. National conscription played a pivotal role in this. Policymakers sought to send segments of the citizenry to the battlefield under various pretexts, primarily centered on the defense of the nation.
This phenomenon occurred chiefly within advanced nations, aligning with the "intent of those in supreme control" that I mentioned earlier. Similar attempts were also observed in developed nations that faced severe fiscal crises after failing to successfully navigate the transition period of robot automation.
Q: They essentially drove their own citizens into a slaughterhouse. Looking back from the perspective of the victims, it is impossible not to describe it as truly horrific.
A (Doina): I agree. In most cases, the targets were "prioritized." Groups such as refugees, migrant ethnicities, or those who were relatively disadvantaged in terms of religious or social influence—sometimes numbering in the millions—were singled out. This biased distribution of Tte-mok©Ido often led to massacres triggered by civil wars or riots. The spread of far-right nationalism and the pervasive sentiments common in some advanced nations during the first half of the 21st century acted as "dry kindling" for the full-scale ignition of such patterns. What is noteworthy is that the policymakers were indiscriminate in achieving their goals, regardless of whether they sent these people to the battlefield or not.
Q: The term "Great Cleanup" is truly terrifying.
A (Doina): I feel the same way. However, at the same time, one might find it to be a fitting expression from a metaphorical standpoint.
